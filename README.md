Sunroofer aggregates solar potential across sets of buildings, using data scraped from Google's [Project Sunroof](https://www.google.com/get/sunroof). The /data/sf_schools.csv file contains a sample data set showing the aggregated solar potential of all schools in the San Francisco Unified School District system.

This had been hosted an Sunroofer.org, and may yet be again, one day.
